# The Game

My phone buzzed just as the clerk rang up a bottle of milk. "Queen to the hidey hole," the text message read. That was all.

I frowned at the screen, looking back at the last several messages as though that would help. Hidey hole? What could she have meant by that?

The clerk wasn't the least bit amused; there was a long line of customers behind me, including the woman I had snuck in front of earlier. "Won't take but a moment!" I had claimed with false cheer, brandishing a bottle of 2%. She had scowled back at me over a cart full of sugary cereals and a reservoir's worth of orange juice, but waved me in.

Of course, there was no way for me to have known that I"d receive the latest move in a long-running game just at the moment that payment was due to the surly grocery clerk. This particular game was perhaps a dozen years old, maybe more. Thirty or so moves had transpired, back and forth, spaced out sporadically over weeks and in some cases many months. 

It was impossible to say when the next move would come, or why. There were days when I'd think of nothing but the game, and I'd puzzle over the next move until at last, just before bed, the perfect strategem would come to me, and there was my next move, ready to dispatch without a moment's notice. Then on the other hand, entire seasons would pass me by as I'd forget about the board altogether, its drama hidden underneath a hundred other concerns, big and small. Until one day, without notice, inspiration would arrive from an unlikely source - a dog cavorting in the park, rain pitter-pattering into an old ceramic pitcher along the side of the house, an email alerting me to a a new statement available online from my bank. In any case it would rouse some idle thought and without fail, a few days later I'd parry back wih something clever, a piece sliding across the board into an unlikely spot.

My opponent must have been on a similar cycle, though really I could only guess. There was no particular pattern to the way her pieces moved, or when she sent her text messages. Certainly, it was impossible to guess what she was thinking. I suppose it always is, but with some players it's easier to guess than with others. She was a perfect conundrum on the chess  board. My sister always had been.

Now my moment in line was stretching into something rather longer than that. "Cash or credit?" the clerk asked. She set her jaw with a particular disdain, her teeth clenched with tension sufficient to say something like, "...or could I interest you in a hole in the ground?"

With dread I realized that I had left my wallet at home; neither cash nor credit were anywhere nearby. I fidgeted with my phone and pulled up the payments app. Up popped a QR code, which I dutifully offered up in supplication. "Neither, I guess?" This last bit with a chuckle. The clerk didn't seem to find it very funny.

It only took a dozen or so attempts with the wonky scanner, and a bit more forebearance on the part of my fellow customers as I finished setting up the payments app, but eventually we figured it out. It was a true team effort, a shining example of capitalism at its finest. The grocery store was $3.49 richer, and I had something to stir into the next morning's coffee. As well, perhaps, as a healthy dose of new enemies.

The game had started without a great deal of ceremony. The first text message was rather prosaic. "Pawn to king 4," my sister wrote me, on an otherwise lazy Saturday afternoon when I was just starting to consider the problem of dinner.

I wasn't quite sure what to think. It had been years since I had laid eyes on so much as a rook or a bishop. After puzzling over it for a moment I recognized the text as a bit of jargon, really the sort of thing that was the province of experienced chess players more than novices such as myself. King's four - that was four rows in front of the King. Since my sister had moved first she was moving a white pawn. There was only one white pawn - the King's pawn - which could move into that particular spot, forward two spaces from its starting position. Actually it was a very pedestrian move, the kind of opening I would use back when I was a kid and my sister managed to cajole me into a game of chess when I had nothing better to do.

Not that I had the slightest idea why my sister chose to send me a fairly humdrum chess opening at this exact uninteresting moment in time. Only that I was by now fairly accustomed to these conversational non-sequitors, enough that I knew better to respond to her enigmatic message with a question mark or five.

Every conversation with her began in just about this  way. She would want to talk about something with me. But first she'd think it over for a day or two, develop a few ideas, consider counter-arguments, come to a conclusion. Only then would I hear from her, usually with a question about her conclusion that belied very little of the original thought. It was my job to catch up as best I could.

A month before my twenty-fifth birthday, I got a call with this question: "Argyle or flannel?" At the time I was lugging a tower of mulch down the garden path, one soggy bag at a time. It was a hot day and I hadn't had enough to drink, so I responded without much thought. Flannel, I said, and foolishly asked what it was about, and how was she doing, and had she talked to mom lately - only to realize that the call had ended as soon as she'd received her answer. Sure enough, a few weeks later I opened my mailbox to find it stuffed with twenty-five flannel socks. They were impossibly cozy, to her credit. I still have three or four pairs floating around somewhere.

So her out-of-nowhere text about an opening chess move was a little confusing - but only a little. I don't remember how I responded to that text. It was a dozen years ago, and whichever phone I had at the time has long since vanished. Very probably, I forgot all about it once I had decoded its arcane meaning... only to encounter it again the next time I had to get in touch with my sister, and respond with something uninspiring, along the lines of "same move for me, I guess."

The game proceeded that way for a while, in fits and starts, my sister's chessmaster jargon answered by a string of decidedly mediocre moves on my part. At some point along the way I realized that her pretentiously encoded chess moves were actually specific and efficient, and I learned to encode mine in turn. Not that it made much of a difference in the quality of my game. "Knight to queen's rook three," I'd text her, after a particularly inspired bit of very focused, strategic thinking, only to have that same knight captured in her next turn, a few months later.

It was she who abandoned the jargon in the first place. Again I can't remember exactly when. I think it began as a cutesy line. Her knight had to return to its original spot on the first row to accomodate a rather clever attack on my own. "Horsey hops home," she wrote. It was a couple of days before I realized she was referring to our game, and then a full week before I realized what she meant by it. At some point I realized that she also meant it as a reminder of the great big golden lab we had when we were kids, who earned the name Horsey by gamely giving us rides around the living room.

Horsey was just one in a long line of pets who managed to survive in a household with the two of us through the years. There were Salt and Pepper - the former was a gray kitten, and the latter was white, because that was my sister's sense of humor at the time. Next came Doctor the turtle, Colonel the goldfish, Brother the rat (my sister, ever the comedian), and Abe the iguana. Briefly we discussed getting a zebra just to bring the menagerie to its logical conclusion, but fate intervened in the form of a long-lost cousin headed overseas. Could we care for his beloved parakeet? We could, and after one look at her silky coat, a resplendent arrangement of every color imaginable, we could name her nothing besides Rainbow. There was a foster cat who seemed to bat at every ball that came his way with his right paw; he was destined to be Southpaw. A pair of puppies we were allowed to keep on the strength of a solemn promise to feed them - and who wound up returned to their owner about a month later when their bowls were found empty a few times too many - were Monkey and Curious, though we could never tell which was which. The last in this long line was a snake, obtained during the mildly sadistic years when I enjoyed the thought of watching the creature attack and devour a mouse. I named it Spot because I thought it was funny; my sister grudgingly agreed.

Many of these pets have made their way into our game in one way or the other, even though they're all long gone. For a turn or two, as I recall, the white queen's rook was named Colonel, for instance. When I castled my King, sliding it over to the right side of the board, I wrote something impossibly terse, like "Southpaw's hold." It must have driven my sister nuts.

These sort of inscrutable references or witty jokes - or better still, both at the same time - are pretty much the only way we talk about the game these days. Indeed, it's become the whole point of the enterprise, it seems to me. We've long since abandoned the pretense that the point of the game is to capture the other player's king. Instead, it's to impress the other player with a clever turn of phrase. Certainly, there is no reason the game should have gone on this long. My sister is a far better player than I - has been since before she was old enough to own a chess set- and she could have won hundreds of games against me in the time it's taken us to play this particularly meandering and never-ending game.

It's her way of checking up on me, the way some people like to send each other links to news articles. There's something sweet, if perhaps a little condescending, in it. On the one hand she puts a lot of thought in the game, even though it's not a lot of words. On the other, I'm playing by her rules in every possible way, and that's always been a bit uncomfortable. 

Has it turned out the way she intended, back when we were both twelve years younger? That much I couldn't say for certain. She is nothing if not cunning and annoyingly insightful, the kind of person who could tell you - and often does - how a movie's going to end before the opening credits have finished rolling. But then again, she takes her chess very seriously, and it's not entirely like her to make light of it; still less so to let others do the same. We've been doing precisely that for over half of our adult lives now.

But I don't mind it. In fact I rather enjoy making enemies at the grocery store in exchange for these unpredictable bits of sisterly repartee. I'm not eager to inconvenience others, but if I'm going to do so anyway, there might as well be a memorable story in the bargain. Probably I should steer away from that particular clerk the next time I need a basket of vitals.
